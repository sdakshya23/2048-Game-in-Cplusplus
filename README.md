# 2048-Game-in-Cplusplus
This was a terminal based game which I made using C++
This game was built using some basic concepts of C++
I also took some help from this video: https://youtu.be/tGWhk47ZIm4
It is terminal based working model of the famous game 2048 in which the goal is to make the tile 2048 without running out of moves
